## Warning !
This is a temporary version of the code. It is functional yet, it is not documented nor is it well formatted. A code revision will come shortly (within the next few months).


# Cosserat-Rod-Modeling-of-Continuum-Concentric-PushPull-Robots
This code is associated to the paper Tummers et al., “Continuum concentric push-pull robots: a Cosserat rod model,” IEEE International Journal of Robotics Research to model continuum concentric push-pull robots based on Cosserat rod theory.
